# Airline Startup Plan

**Authors**: John Baumgartner, Mytreyi Abburu, Andreas Budhi

## Business Problem

 Our interest is to tackle the airplane industry, either commercial and/or private planes. Inherently, there are risks associated with certain aircrafts, and the last thing we want is bad publicity involving fatalities. Our task is to analyze and recommend which manufacturer and which type of aircraft are the safest overall for us to start with.


## Data

We are using dataset 'AviationData.csv' from the National Transportation Safety Board.  The data includes accident and incident data from 1962 to 2023 in the United States and beyond.

## Methods

We first filtered the data to only include accidents after the year 2002 and that occurred in the United States only. We then cleaned the 'Make' column of our data so that we could see the actual result of our top 4 manufacturers.

Final dataset N = 

## Results

Looking at our results, 

## Conclusion

Out of the top 4 manufacturers

## Further Investigation

- Explore the prices of each plane and type engine to see whether new or used is more cost-effective.
